# Introducing 

I used this <a href ='https://www.kaggle.com/code/amyjang/monet-cyclegan-tutorial/notebook#Create-submission-file'> notebook </a> as entry point to world of tensorflow and CycleGans.
This noteebok used UNET architecture for generator. My challenge is build something different by myself. 
After researches I choosed the ResNet arch. 

# Training
